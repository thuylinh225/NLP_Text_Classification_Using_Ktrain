# NLP_Text_Classification_Using_Ktrain

Theragun, a media buying company, aims to target consumers who prioritize health and wellness are more likely to consider and purchase their product. To achieve this, they intend to run a media campaign by advertising on news articles related to health and wellness. The goal of this project is to build a deep learning algorithm that can accurately predict whether or not a document is about "healthy living" or "wellness". To accomplish this, we will utilize the K-Train library for building and training the inference model.

K-Train is a library that simplifies deep learning for natural language processing (NLP). It provides an easy-to-use interface for tasks like text classification and named entity recognition. With ktrain, we can preprocess text data, fine-tune pre-trained transformer models, train neural networks, and evaluate model performance.
